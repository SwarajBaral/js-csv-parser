# CSV <-> JSON Service

A basic csv to json and vice verse parser service in JavaScript.

- This project is not meant to be used in actual production. It's just something I created to help me in my daily tasks.
- Haven't used any third party packages for the parsing.
- Just simple string formatting.

## TODO

- [ ] Add file upload service
- [ ] Reformat code to typeScript
- [ ] Optimize the conversion
- [ ] React (Maybe !?!)
